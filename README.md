# CVAE-MNIST
Implementation for VAE in PyTorch

### Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
This is an implementation of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) using TensorFlow. A CVAE is a type of neural network that is trained to generate new samples from a given set of input conditions. It is a type of generative model that is particularly useful for applications such as image generation, where the model is trained to generate new images based on a set of input conditions, such as image labels.

### Dependencies
This implementation requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.9
Pytorch
NumPy
opencv-python

### Dataset
The model was trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a dataset of hand-written digits.

### Example
![0](FromZ/0.png "Generated by Hidden Feature")
![example](FromX/0.png "Reconstructed by hand-written digits")
![8_1](8/1.png "Generated from specific digit")
![8_2](8/2.png "Generated from specific digit")
